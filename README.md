# ChatEnginar

Hello!, I will talk about an interesting project that allows you to create your own Arduino chat robot, called ChatEnginar

ChatEnginar uses a microphone to capture sound and sends it to Google Translate to convert it into text. Then, it sends the text to a large language model called ChatGPT to get an answer to your question. ChatGPT sends the answer back to ChatEnginar as text, which is then read out loud to the user through a speaker.

ChatEnginar is a robot built on an Arduino and contains a simple electronic circuit, making it easy for users to create their own ChatEnginar robots. This project can be a great option for those interested in both electronics and artificial intelligence.

With the increasing interest in voice assistants and conversation robots, the ChatEnginar project allows you to create your own personal assistant. You can ask your Arduino-based ChatEnginar robot a variety of questions just by speaking.

ChatEnginar is both educational and fun. By building your own robot, you can explore new technologies and improve your skills in the fields of artificial intelligence and robotics.

This project is a hobby project may be developed slower than I expected
