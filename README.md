# ChatEnginar

Hello! Allow me to introduce you to an innovative project, ChatEnginar, a concept which enables you to create your own voice-controlled chatbot.

ChatEnginar is a mobile application written in Kotlin. Its primary function is to interact with users purely through voice. It harnesses the power of your device's microphone to capture your voice and convert it into text using Google Translate or an alternative method.

This transcribed text is then fed into a state-of-the-art language model, ChatGPT, which crafts a response to the user's query. The generated response is converted back into speech using a text-to-speech translator and delivered back to the user.

ChatEnginar stands out with its minimalist design and strict adherence to voice-based interaction, not allowing text inputs. This feature sets it apart from other chatbots available in the market, making it a truly unique voice-focused conversation bot.

This project is an excellent exploration ground for those curious about the intersection of mobile development and artificial intelligence. As a hobby project, the development pace might be leisurely than anticipated, but it provides ample opportunities for in-depth learning and experimentation.

Join the journey of ChatEnginar and delve into the exciting world of AI-driven conversations!
